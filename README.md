### On Google Compute Engine

If you are running this client on Google Compute Engine, you can skip to the developer's guide. We handle authorization for you with no configuration.

### Elsewhere

* Visit the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project).
* Create a new project or click on an existing project.
* Enable billing if you haven't already.
* On the "APIs & auth" tab, click APIs section and turn on the following. You may need to enable billing in order to use these services.
	* Google Cloud Datastore API
	* Google Cloud Storage
	* Google Cloud Storage JSON API
* Once API access is enabled, switch back to "APIs & auth" section on the navigation panel and switch to "Credentials" page.
* Click on "Create new client ID" to create a new **service account**. Once the account is created, a p12 file will be auto downloaded. The downloaded file is the private key you'll need for authorization.
* You'll the following for auth configuration:
	* Developers Console project's ID (e.g. bamboo-shift-455)
	* Service account's email address (e.g. xxx@developer.gserviceaccount.com)

  then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

You can sign these electronically (just scroll to the bottom).
